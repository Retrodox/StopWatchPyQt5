# Stopwatch Application

This is a simple stopwatch application built with PyQt5. I made it in order to try and better understand PyQt5's library and some of its features. The application features a start, pause, reset, and exit button, along with a display for the elapsed time in the format of minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- PyQt5

## Installation

1. Install Python 3 if you haven't already. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install PyQt5 using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install PyQt5

##Running the Application

1. Run the launch.bat or the shortcut I made for it in order to launch. Make sure your libraries are installed before.

## Features

- Start, pause, and reset the stopwatch.
- Display the elapsed time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
- Frameless window with rounded corners.
- Customizable color scheme through the stylesheet.
